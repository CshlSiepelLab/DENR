\arguments{
\item{transcripts}{a \link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges-class} object that must
contain a metadata column with a transcript id and may contain an additional
column with a gene id}

\item{transcript_name_column}{A string that indicates which column in the
GRanges object contain the transcript names}

\item{gene_name_column}{a string that indicates which column in the
GRanges object contains the gene names (not required)}

\item{bin_size}{An integer, used to tail the gene region. Default is 50bp.}

\item{distance}{the distance within which two transcripts are
considered connected}

\item{mask_start_bins}{the number of bins with non-zero entries at the start
of a transcript that should be masked (Used for masking both start and end if
strand is \'*\')}

\item{mask_end_bins}{the number of bins with non-zero entries at the end
of a transcript that should be masked (Ignored if strand is \'*\')}

\item{bin_operation}{Three different modes to deal with decimals in the
transript model (due to partial overlap of the first or last exon and bins).
Either "ceiling", "floor", or "round" (default: "round").}

\item{threads}{number of threads that can be used}
}
\value{
an transcript_quantifier object
